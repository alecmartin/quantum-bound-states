Quantum Bound States is a Physics Education Technology (PhET) simulation describing the wave functions of a particle
trapped in a potential well of various shapes. Shapes include a square box, an asymmetric box, the coulomb potential,
and the harmonic oscillator potential.

Both the real and imaginary parts of the wave function are displayed, along with their time evolution and the magnitude
of the probability distribution.

Various energy levels are represented as part of the graph of the potential well.  Both the potential well and the mass
of the particle can be perturbed by the user, changing the shape of the wave functions.

Because all of the potential well shapes provided yield an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation, these changes
will not require perturbation theory to solve.This project will rebuild the simulation in Javascript as part of PhET’s
effort to port all of their Java simulations into a more web-accessible format.

Although the Java version of the simulation allows between one and ten wells, we will focus on one well, moving on to
two or more wells if there is time.

Users of the simulation should gain an understanding of quantum bound states through exploration of the simulation.
